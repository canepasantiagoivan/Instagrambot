Welcome to this repository, where you will find scripts to automate some tasks on Instagram using Python and Selenium.

# üìã Repository Contents
**create_unfollowers_list.py:** This script is responsible for scrolling and comparing lists of followers, creating a list called unfollowers.csv that contains those users who have stopped following us.

**stop_following.py:** This script stops following the users found in the unfollowers.csv list and adds these users to the add.csv list.

**follow_bot.py:** This script segments users by gender and sends follow requests to all users from another user's follower list, a followed list, or a likes list to ensure activity. Each user who is sent a request is copied into add.csv to avoid sending two requests to the same user.

**follow_bot_without_gender.py:** This script is an update of the previous script that removes the gender segmentation model so as not to load it if it is not going to be used.

# üìö Pre-requisites
To use these scripts, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

selenium pandas beautifulsoup4 pickle random csv datetime

In addition, you will need the Chrome WebDriver, which you can download from here.

üíª How to use the scripts

Clone this repository locally.

bash git clone https://github.com/username/instagram-bot
**Update the username and password variables with your Instagram username and password in each script.**

username = 'enter username' # Change this to your Instagram username

password = 'enter password' # Change this to your Instagram password

Update the driver_path variable with the path to the Chrome WebDriver.
driver_path = 'path/to/chromedriver.exe' # Change this to the path to the Chrome WebDriver

Run the scripts in the order you wish using Python.

**python create_unfollowers_list.py 
python stop_following.py 
python follow_bot.py 
python follow_bot_without_gender.py**
